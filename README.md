# TriAlgo
As a semester project for the course of "Design and Analysis of ALgorithms" (CS302),I implemented a number of algorithms in python.
List of the algorithms that i implemented as follows:
Dynamic Programming Algorithms -->  Matrix Chain Multiplication and Knapsack
Data Structure ALgorithms  -->  BST , RBT and KD tree
Sorting --> Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Heap sort

I also used python library turtle to visualize the structure of the tree (for Data structure algorithms)
