# TriAlgo
As a semester project for the course of "Design and Analysis of ALgorithms" (CS302),I implemented a number of algorithms in python.
List of the algorithms that i implemented as follows:
Dynamic Programming Algorithms -->  Matrix Chain Multiplication and Knapsack
Data Structure ALgorithms  -->  BST , RBT and KD tree
Sorting --> Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Heap sort

I also used python library turtle to visualize the structure of the tree (for Data structure algorithms)

MainApp.py is the main application so run it like any other python program to run the whole program
file.txt contains an example of input data. you use this kind of input for tree (key-value pair) or just simple values like below
file.txt =>  
10 20 30 40 50

This will work for sorting too.
